# Pro-Tools-Rosetta-Opener
A pair of Apple Scripts that can open Pro Tools in either Native or Rosetta mode

# How to install

Download the two script files: [Open PT using Apple Silicon](https://github.com/fadersolo/Pro-Tools-Rosetta-Opener/blob/main/Open%20PT%20using%20Apple%20Silicon.scpt) and [Open PT using Rosetta](https://github.com/fadersolo/Pro-Tools-Rosetta-Opener/blob/main/Open%20PT%20using%20Rosetta.scpt), they each do exactly what they say. I put them both in ~/Library/Scripts and I use it from the Script Menu in the Menubar.
